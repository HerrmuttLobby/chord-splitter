HERMMUTT LOBBY's Chord Splitter JS 0.6

Description :
-------------
The Chord Splitter is a max4live tool created to split and sort a chord played on a keyboard into indexed note that can be used somewhere else in your track.




Usage :
-------
Check out the demo and play some chords on your keyboard.

--

Use the sender on a midi listening track (midi comming either from midi clip or from external midi device).
Put the receiver on any other midi track folowed by instruments, the receiver is intended to be used as a source of notes.
Activate on each receiver a subset of index.

Play some chords on the splitter track and change some notes without changing the whole chord.

Adding, or removing the root note (lower) has a maximal effect by moving all the notes index up or down by 1. 

Listen to how the chords is rearenged between the receivers.
